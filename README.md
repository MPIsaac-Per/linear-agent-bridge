# linear-claude-bridge

Run your Claude Code setup as a Linear agent. Delegate an issue to it or
message it in an agent session, and a Claude Agent SDK session runs on
your machine, in a working directory you choose, with everything that
directory carries: CLAUDE.md instructions, MCP servers, skills. Replies
land in the issue's agent-session thread.

This is a minimal reference implementation (under 1,000 lines, no framework,
tested). It is not a coding agent; for assign-an-issue-get-a-PR flows,
see [Cyrus](https://github.com/ceedaragents/cyrus). This bridge is for
talking to an agent that knows your context: a knowledge base, an ops
repo, a project directory.

Runs on Claude Code subscription auth. No Anthropic API key.

## Architecture

```
Linear (mention / delegate / follow-up prompt)
  -> webhook: AgentSessionEvent (created | prompted)
  -> src/server.ts        verify HMAC, ack < 5s, first activity < 10s
  -> src/queue.ts         serial execution, concurrency 1
  -> src/runtime/claude.ts  Agent SDK query(), cwd = KB_PATH, resume
  -> src/linear/client.ts   agentActivityCreate (thought/action/response)
```

Session mapping (Linear session id -> SDK session id) and Linear's rotating
OAuth token pair persist in JSON files, so follow-up prompts resume the same
conversation and access refreshes without another browser authorization.

## Prerequisites

- Node 22+, a machine that stays on, and [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
  installed and logged in as the user who runs the service.
- A Linear workspace where you can create OAuth applications.
- A public HTTPS route to the service (tailscale funnel, cloudflared, or
  any reverse proxy).

## Setup

### 1. Create the Linear OAuth app

Linear Settings -> API -> Applications -> new application:

- Name it (this is the agent's visible name), fill developer fields.
- Redirect URI: `http://localhost:3979/oauth/callback`
- Toggle **Webhooks** on. Note the pre-generated signing secret.
- Webhook URL: your public HTTPS host + `/webhook` (can be corrected later).
- Under **App events**, check **Agent session events**. There is no scopes
  picker on the app; scopes are requested at install time.

### 2. Configure and run

```bash
npm install && cp .env.example .env
# fill LINEAR_CLIENT_ID, LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET, LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET
# set LINEAR_ACCESS_TOKEN=pending (placeholder until step 3)
# set KB_PATH to the directory whose context the agent should carry
npm run dev
```

### 3. Install the app as an agent (actor=app)

Open this URL (your client id substituted), approve the install:

```
https://linear.app/oauth/authorize?client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3979%2Foauth%2Fcallback&response_type=code&scope=read,write,app:assignable,app:mentionable&actor=app
```

The callback stores Linear's access and refresh tokens in
`data/oauth-tokens.json`. The app now appears as an assignable agent in your
workspace. Access tokens expire after 24 hours; the bridge consumes the
stored refresh token, saves Linear's replacement pair, and retries the failed
request automatically.

`LINEAR_ACCESS_TOKEN` is a bootstrap value. After authorization, the token
store takes precedence across process and machine restarts. Keep the token
store on persistent local storage. Its file mode is `0600`, and `data/` is
excluded from Git.

#### Upgrading an existing installation

Installations created before refresh-token support have only an access token
in `.env`. Pull the new version, rebuild and restart the service, then open the
authorization URL above once. The callback will create the token store. No
further browser authorization is needed during normal token rotation.

If Linear returns `401` and the bridge reports that no refresh token is
stored, repeat the authorization step. Removing the app from Linear, revoking
its grant, or deleting the token store also requires authorization again.

### 4. Expose the webhook

On macOS, `./deploy/install.sh` builds the service, installs a launchd
user agent (so the SDK sees your Claude Code credentials), opens a
tailscale funnel, and prints the webhook URL to paste into the app config.

Any other HTTPS ingress works; the service only needs POST /webhook
reachable. If your TLS terminator runs on a different host,
`deploy/tcp_forward.py` is a dependency-free TCP forwarder to bridge the
last hop over a private network.

### 5. Talk to it

Delegate any issue to the agent, or message it in the session thread.
First thought lands within seconds; answers take as long as a real agent
session takes.

## Field notes (things the docs won't tell you)

- The `prompted` webhook carries the user's text at
  `agentActivity.content.body`, not `agentActivity.body`. Reading the
  wrong field yields an agent that answers "Standing by." to everything,
  because it is resumed with an empty prompt.
- AgentSessionEvent payloads put their fields at the top level of the
  webhook body (no `data` wrapper, unlike data-change webhooks).
- The HMAC-SHA256 signature (`linear-signature` header) covers the raw
  body; the replay-protection timestamp is `webhookTimestamp` inside the
  JSON, milliseconds, reject beyond 60s skew.
- Ack the webhook before doing any work (5s limit) and emit a thought
  immediately on `created` (10s liveness limit), or Linear marks the
  session unresponsive.
- Keep runtime execution serial. Concurrent headless Claude sessions on
  one host have produced cross-session content contamination.
- `permissionMode: "bypassPermissions"` does nothing without
  `allowDangerouslySkipPermissions: true`; the SDK requires the pair.
- Old Agent SDK versions (0.1.x) fail to resume sessions whose transcript
  contains empty text blocks (API 400: "text content blocks must be
  non-empty"). Use 0.3.x or later.
- Linear OAuth access tokens expire after 24 hours. Every refresh returns a
  replacement access token and refresh token; persist the pair atomically and
  retry one failed 401 request with the replacement access token.

## Security notes

The webhook endpoint verifies signatures and rejects stale timestamps;
`/healthz` and `/oauth/callback` are the only other routes. Understand
what you are wiring up: anyone who can mention the agent in your Linear
workspace steers an unattended agent session running with permissions
bypassed in `KB_PATH`. Use it in workspaces you trust, and scope `KB_PATH`
deliberately.

## Billing note

The Claude Agent SDK currently draws on Claude Code subscription
credentials and standard plan limits. Anthropic announced, then paused, a
change that would move Agent SDK usage to a separate metered credit pool.
Check current terms before depending on the economics.
